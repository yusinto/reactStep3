# reactStep3
Hot module replacement (hmr) is an invaluable tool when developing in react. As you make changes to your code hmr automatically flushes
them to the browser, reflecting the changes automatically without you having to refresh the browser.

It's a bit like liveReload but so so much better. It is supported natively in webpack and you don't have to run a separate server to listen for changes. It really is
next gen javascript coding. If you are serious about javascript and react development, you need to use this tool.
